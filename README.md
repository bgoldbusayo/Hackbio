Dashboards for Biology: Stop Treating Your Plots Like PowerPoint
Introduction
Biological data analysis does not end when a plot is generated. Yet, many researchers treat data visualization as a final presentation step rather than a tool for exploration and decision-making. Most figures are exported as static images and placed into slides, where interaction, context, and flexibility are lost. This “PowerPoint mindset” limits how biological insights are discovered and communicated.
The Problem with Static Plots
Static plots freeze data in time. They:
Prevent users from exploring alternative thresholds or parameters


Hide metadata such as sample identity or experimental conditions


Make it difficult for collaborators or clinicians to ask follow-up questions


In biology, especially genomics and clinical research, decisions depend on patterns, outliers, and trends that often require interaction.
Why Dashboards Are Better
Dashboards built with R tools like Shiny and Quarto allow users to:
Filter samples dynamically


Adjust thresholds (e.g., fold change, p-values)


Explore multiple views of the same dataset


Link plots to tables and annotations


Instead of presenting a single “final” figure, dashboards support continuous data interrogation.
Dashboards Support Better Scientific Decisions
Dashboards shift visualization from decoration to decision-making. For example:
A clinician can explore patient-specific gene expression instead of viewing cohort averages


A researcher can test how results change with different normalization methods


Reviewers and collaborators can reproduce figures directly from code


This improves transparency, reproducibility, and trust in biological findings.
Conclusion
Biological plots should not be treated like PowerPoint images. By adopting interactive dashboards, scientists move closer to reproducible, transparent, and decision-driven research. Visualization should not end analysis, it should enable it.
